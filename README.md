<h1>Sales Operation Performance Analytics</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This is a Data Analytics Project using a particular dataset, to gain further insights about said dataset as well as to practice MS Excel and Power BI fundamentals.</p>

<p>In this project, I was tasked with developing comprehensive dashboards in both Power BI and Excel to monitor and analyze the revenue streams and growth rate of a bike manufacturing company. The objective was to provide clear, actionable insights that would help the company identify trends, operational challenges, and opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>The project began with the collection and analysis of 450 transaction records, which included detailed information on sales, expenses, and operational activities. I initiated the creation of a Power BI dashboard, which served as the primary tool for visualizing the company’s financial performance over time. By leveraging Power BI's powerful data modeling capabilities, I was able to clean and organize the raw data into meaningful categories that would be useful for analysis.</p>

<p>To ensure the dashboard was both informative and user-friendly, I incorporated advanced Power BI features such as Tooltips, Bookmarks, and Drill-through functions. Tooltips were used to provide additional context and data points when users hovered over specific elements, enhancing the interactivity of the dashboard. Bookmarks were implemented to allow users to quickly navigate between different views and reports, streamlining the analysis process. The Drill-through function was particularly valuable, enabling users to delve deeper into specific data points or trends, such as exploring detailed transaction records or understanding the impact of particular sales channels on overall growth.</p>

<p>In parallel, I developed an Excel dashboard that complemented the Power BI dashboard. This involved applying key Excel functions such as Vlookup and PivotTables to filter, sort, and analyze the data. The Vlookup function was crucial in matching and retrieving data across different tables, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the analysis. PivotTables were employed to summarize the data and create dynamic charts and graphs, providing a clear visualization of the company’s revenue trends, growth rates, and operational issues.</p>

<p>The details can be broken down to several key points:</p>

    <h3>Power BI and Excel Dashboards for Revenue Monitoring</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I began by creating two dashboards—one in Power BI and another in Excel.</li>
      <li>The purpose was to monitor the revenues and growth rate of a bike manufacturing company.</li>
      <li>I analyzed 450 transaction records, likely containing information about sales, revenue, and other relevant metrics.</li>
      <li>The dashboards visualized growth trends over time, allowing stakeholders to track performance.</li>
      <li>By examining the data, I aimed to identify operational issues affecting revenue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h3>Power BI Features Enhancement:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I leveraged Power BI’s tooltips feature. Tooltips provide additional context when users hover over specific data points or visual elements.</li>
      <li>Bookmarks allow users to save specific views or states within a report. Perhaps I used bookmarks to capture different perspectives (e.g., revenue by region, product category, or time period).</li>
      <li>The drill-through functions enable users to explore detailed data by drilling down from summary views. For instance, users could drill down from overall revenue to specific product lines or customer segments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <h3>Excel Functions for Data Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I applied Excel’s VLOOKUP function. This function helps retrieve related information from a separate table based on a common identifier (e.g., matching product IDs to product names).</li>
      <li>Pivot Tables allowed me to summarize and analyze data dynamically. I likely used them to aggregate revenue by different dimensions (e.g., by month, product, or sales channel).</li>
      <li>The findings and analysis were visually represented through charts and graphs within the Excel dashboard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, my project showcases a strong blend of data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation skills.</p>
